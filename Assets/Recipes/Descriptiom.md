**3. Spaghetti alla carbonara (Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, and pancetta)**

_Main food allergies: Milk and eggs_

**Description:**

For those who know Rome well, Vicolo della Scrofa is one of the most characteristic streets, rich in symbolism. It seems that the first Carbonara was made in 1944 in a trattoria there, hence the name of the alley. The most reliable story in fact relates the encounter between the ingredients available to the American soldiers and the imagination of a Roman cook. The result was the prototype of spaghetti alla carbonara: eggs, bacon (later guanciale) and cheese. Gradually the recipe evolved to the one we all know and love today and we can appreciate it in our Roman (and voracious!) friends' homes, in a trattorias or in starred restaurants of the capital alike, throughout Italy and abroad, in countless versions: with or without pepper, with one yolk per person or the addition of at least one whole egg, with guanciale or strips of bacon. The carbonara sauce is prepared in a matter of minutes. Just think that all you need is spicy guanciale cut into strips, a golden cream made with yolks (in our version) and a lot of grated Pecorino cheese. With its simplicity and the richness of ingredients, the recipe for spaghetti carbonara is closely related to three other cornerstones of genuine Italian cuisine: the amatriciana, the gricia and spaghetti cacio e pepe! This is so true that there is even a recipe that combines all those recipes together, called pasta alla zozzona.

**4. Frittata (Italian omelet-like dish made with eggs and various fillings)**

_Main food allergies: Eggs_

**Description:**

A frittata is an Italian omelet in which the add-ins (potatoes, ham, veggies, rice, what have you) are beaten directly into the eggs, instead of folded into the middle as a filling.  Generally, it’s cooked first on the stovetop, then finished under the broiler. 

Some people cook a frittata entirely on the stovetop, flipping it during the cooking process instead of transferring the pan under the broiler.  Some people are also circus acrobats or professional skydivers, and this is an easy frittata recipe anyone can pull off.

Frittatas are great warm or at room temperature, happily hanging out for a couple of hours before being cut up and served. Ideal for brunch, they are a subtle way of saying, “I’m not making individual omelets for all of you.”  They’re also a good potluck notion and, when cut into small squares, a lovely hors d’oeuvre.  And, because it’s so easy to make a vegetarian frittata, it solves the need for a vegetarian appetizer which should always be part of your offerings.

**5. Mapo tofu (Chinese dish made with tofu, chili, and fermented soybean paste)**

_Main food allergies: Soy_

**Description:**

In the 1860s China’s last great imperial dynasty was entering its final chapters, and Mrs. Chen survived smallpox at a great cost, leaving her disfigured from scarring. Left to the city outskirts at Wanfu bridge entering the northern edges of the city, she and her husband operated a humble road-side eatery called the Chen Xingsheng Restaurant.

Though there are several legends involving how Mrs. Chen’s mapo tofu recipe became popularized, (via traders asking her to cook their wares, a tired businessman seeking shelter, or meat-eating customers who wanted to upgrade her vegetarian version) Mrs. Chen’s mapo tofu recipe became renown, and hungry patrons were told to identify the humble stall through her appearance: “Ma” meaning scarred with pockmarks, and “Po” meaning old lady. Today, the Scarred Old Lady’s tofu is celebrated the world over, and is part of the reason Chengdu became recognized as a UNESCO culinary city.

Chengdu records from 1909 show that the Chen family eventually embraced the popular name, re-registering their business as Chen Mapo Tofu Restaurant and listed as one of the 23 most famous restaurants in Chengdu in the late Qing Dynasty. Its flavor, price, and suitability with rice meant mapo tofu became a Chinese food staple, spreading nationwide.

The best philosophy for mapo tofu is: The simpler, the better. Even though the ingredients are humble, mapo tofu is seen as a test of any aspiring chef’s skills. Importantly, the right ingredients are crucial in creating an authentic taste, which we’ve supplied for you here in our Sichuan Box.

**7. Sushi (Japanese dish consisting of rice, fish, and other ingredients)**

_Main food allergies: Fish_

**Description:**

Embarking on a sushi journey, we often find ourselves immersed in the allure of fresh toppings like salmon, shrimp, or maguro tuna. Yet, beneath these delectable layers lies a crucial element that shapes the very essence of sushi – the rice.

Consider this exploration into the heart of sushi craftsmanship, where the rice isn't just an accompaniment but a vital character in the culinary narrative. In the art of sushi-making, a perfectly seasoned rice, known as sumeshi or shari, takes center stage. The process involves a careful dance of vinegar, sugar, and salt, rooted in Japanese culinary tradition as a safeguard against unwanted bacteria when consuming raw fish.

The magic of Japanese rice, particularly the short-grain japonica variety, lies in its distinctive characteristics. Plump, starchy grains create a texture that is simultaneously fluffy and firm, sticking together effortlessly while holding onto moisture. Enter Koshihikari, a rice brand celebrated as the epitome of Japanese rice excellence. Renowned for its robust stickiness, aromatic richness, and umami flavor, Koshihikari isn't just reserved for sushi; it stands tall in various culinary realms.

Regional nuances add another layer to the story, with Koshihikari from Niigata earning acclaim as the pinnacle of perfection. Sasanishiki and hitomebore emerge as distinguished alternatives, each contributing its unique nuance to the art of sushi rice.

Unlocking the secrets of sushi chefs reveals a fascinating blend of tradition and innovation. The artful combination of new and old rice enhances vinegar absorption, while experimenting with blends like Koshihikari with other premium varieties creates a symphony of taste, texture, and aroma.

As we anticipate our next sushi experience, let's elevate our appreciation for the unsung hero beneath the toppings – the rice. It's not just a backdrop; it's a pivotal player, contributing to the symphony of flavors that defines the magic of sushi.

**8. Valencian paella (Spanish rice dish often made with seafood, including shellfish)**

_Main food allergies: Shellfish_

**Description:**

If you’re dead-set on eating paella when you visit Spain, you’re not alone. Paella is probably the most famous Spanish food throughout the world, and one countless visitors to Spain have on their bucket lists. But while you’d be forgiven for thinking that paella is a staple at restaurants and in homes throughout the country, it’s especially highly revered in its home region of Valencia.

Valencia’s climate is perfect for growing rice, and locals have enjoyed paella in one form or another for centuries.

It all started when laborers working the fields in Valencia’s inland areas would cook rice in a flat pan with whatever vegetables and meat they could find. Healthy, hearty and easy to make, it was perfect after a long morning of hard manual labor.

Early recipes had some variations, but most paella traditionalists agree that true paella valenciana is made with chicken, rabbit, snails, green beans, and local garrofó beans (similar to lima beans). Together with a slow-cooked sofrito, beautiful crimson saffron, and the rice itself, this is Valencian paella in its purest form.

Nowadays, you’ll find plenty of variations on paella, including seafood and “mixed” (think surf-and-turf) varieties, many of which are just as delicious as the original. But not all paellas are created equal. Thanks to its iconic status outside of Spain, plenty of restaurants serve subpar versions in order to cater to unsuspecting tourists.

**11. Waldorf Salad (a classic salad made with apples, grapes, walnuts, and celery, mixed in a mayonnaise-based dressing)**

_Main food allergies: Celery_

**Description:**

This updated Waldorf Salad recipe has all the classic components (apples, celery, grapes, and walnuts) but a modern mayonnaise dressing that is lightened with whipped cream. It’s a tasty blast from the past that makes an excellent party salad.

While the original Waldorf Salad originated in New York City at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the salad smacks of Midwestern taste and sensibilities.

Nothing screams “Midwest!” like a salad dressing made with whipped cream and mayonnaise (except maybe one made with Miracle Whip). Waldorf Salad bears a striking resemblance to Creamy Cucumber Salad, Snickers Salad, Grape Salad, and 24-Hour Fruit Salad, and not just in the dressing.

Waldorf Salad is made with crunchy apples and celery, either grapes or raisins, and walnuts (although the walnuts weren’t in the original). The whole salad is typically served on a bed of lettuce, although I didn’t include that here. I imagine Waldorf Salad at a potluck, and a bed of lettuce leaves is just too fussy for this Midwesterner.

But if you’re enjoying it for a lunch, a bed of lettuce would be a nice, New York touch.
